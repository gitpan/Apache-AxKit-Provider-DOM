Apache::AxKit::Provider::DOM

   A Base Class For Parsed-XML Providers

Apache::AxKit::Provider::DOM allows to pass a parsed XML document
directly to AxKit. It can be used as a base class for application
providers, that create XML documents in memory. So
Apache::AxKit::Provider::DOM provides an easy way to write
application providers for AxKit 1.6.

Installation
============

Apache::AxKit::Provider::DOM was implemented for AxKit 1.6. it may
works with older versions of AxKit but I havn't tested it on any other
than 1.6

If you have AxKit 1.6 installed you just run:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test
 # as superuser
 $ make install

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself.
